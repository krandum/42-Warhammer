<- Spaceship ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Spaceship class is the most extensive class in this game. It provides all
the tools necessary for the scripts to be able to simply call some functions and
look into some variables in order to run the entirety of the game. Because of this
it is quite lengthy.

Spaceship implements IUpkeep and uses two traits: Collidable and Damageable.

Collidable provides a platform for all objects in the game to check whether or not
there is another object in any square, provided that each of these objects give
it the tools it will need need in order to probe each of these objects.

Damageable provides a much simpler platform for objects that can suffer damage to
deal and take damage with much fewer function calls, taking advantage of the
Weapon infrastructure.

Spaceship provides the following additional methods:

int 		public final function move( $amount);
Attempts to move in a direction and triggers an abrubt stop if an obstacle is
found.

void		public final function turn( $mod );
Turns the ship, making the necessary calculations.
