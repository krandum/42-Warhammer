<- Weapon ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Weapon class provides the architecture for ships to attack each other.

Being an abstract class, Weapons tend to be more unique and as such a big role
this class plays is in requiring the existance of these key functions.

int			abstract public function shoot($x, $y);
Shoot combines the capabilities of both checkRange and getDamage, allowing child
classes to provide unique effects upon trigger.

int			abstract public function checkRange( $x, $y );
Checks whether or not the particular space is within range of the weapon, and if
so determines how easily the attack would be to hit.

int			protected function getDamage( $dc );
According to a particular difficulty class, getDamage rolls all of the dice
that have been stored on the weapon and gets the numeric value of how many
of the rolls were hits.
