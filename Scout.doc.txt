The smallest and most numerous of the ships, the scouts are the pieces that
determine the battle. Highly maneuverable, scouts specialize and sneaking up to
enemies and becoming stationary next to them, enabling their cannons to deal
additional damage. Scouts are fragile but excel at fleeing once injured.
